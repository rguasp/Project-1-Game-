# Kitty Invader -Game-
Using HTML, CSS, Javascript to create a space invader spin - off.

Development

Kitty Invader is a spin-off of a very popular arcade game called Space Invaders. This is the first game I have ever programmed. My biggest struggles were with collision detection and constantly having to refactor my code. I ran into alot of speed bumps but at the end of the day i have a working game.

Huge Thanks to the Teacher, TA's, and my Classmates for all the support and help with my code!!
