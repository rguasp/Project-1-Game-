                Space Invaders is an arcade video game created 
                by Tomohiro Nishikado and released in 1978. 
                It was originally manufactured and sold 
                by Taito in Japan, and was later licensed 
                for production in the United States by 
                the Midway division of Bally. Space Invaders 
                is one of the earliest shooting games and 
                the aim is to defeat waves of aliens with 
                a laser cannon to earn as many points as 
                possible. In designing the game, Nishikado 
                drew inspiration from popular media: Breakout, 
                The War of the Worlds,Space Battleship Yamato, 
                and Star Wars. To complete it, he had to design 
                custom hardware and development tools.
